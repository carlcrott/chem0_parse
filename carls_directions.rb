CREATING NEW CHEMOINFORMATIC PROCESSES WORKS!!!!!

"To a solution of 3-bromobenzophenone (1.00 g, 4 mmol) in MeOH (15 mL) was added sodium borohydride (0.3 mL, 8 mmol) portionwise at rt and the suspension was stirred at rt for 1-24 h. The reaction was diluted slowly with water and extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was washed successively with water, brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated to give the title compound as oil (0.8 g, 79%), which was used in the next reaction without further purification. MS (ESI, pos. ion) m/z: 247.1 (M-OH)."

## NOTE:
<phlebas> "delinquentme: sinatra doesnt know or care about how you manage your database and tables. whether you use a schema or no relational database at all is not sinatra's concern
if you want a schema.rb, write yourself one, if you want config files, put them somewhere and write code to read them
it's not a framework ;)"
